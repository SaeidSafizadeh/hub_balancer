# Hub Balancer â€” Conceptual Design Stage

This repository documents the **conceptual design** of a hub balancer intended for **E-bike electromotors**.  
The project began as a **team collaboration** but did not progress beyond the conceptual design and research phase.  
It remains a solid foundation for anyone interested in developing **low-cost, adaptable rotor balancing solutions**.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
Balancing E-bike motor hubs is essential for:
- Reducing **mechanical vibration** and noise
- Extending **component lifespan**
- Improving **rider comfort** and **operational safety**

Our work focused on:
- Reviewing balancing methods for small-scale electric motors
- Investigating **force and vibration sensing technologies** (piezoelectric, strain gauge, MEMS accelerometers)
- Outlining a **cost-effective calibration approach** without expensive reference devices
- Proposing **data acquisition & filtering strategies** for accurate unbalance detection
- Designing adaptable structural layouts for various rotor masses and conditions
